An interactive app that helps me to keep my favourite/regular websites organised in one place. The app can taken as an advanced version of a To-do-list app.

3. Click one of the categories on the Category UI to make it the current working or active category.
4. On the Websites UI, enter a new website(url and name) to be added to the current working category.
5. Repeat step 4 entering a new website.
6. To visit one of the saved websites, click the desired website from the list and the website will be opened in a new tab/window.
7. To navigate to other categories, repeat step 1 - 5.
8. To delete a category and its contents, click the bin icon of the respective category.
